# Support

If this helped you in any way, you can contribute to the package's long term survival by supporting me:

### [ðŸ’œ Support my open-source work on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pratik227)

Be sure to check out my sponsor page.

(GitHub currently **doubles your support**! So if you support me with $10/mo, I will $20 instead! They're alchemists ðŸ˜‰)

Thank you so much!!!
